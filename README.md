# BusinessCard
Reviewer 1:
The code compiled and ran as expected, no obvious coding errors were present. 

There were two windows with navigation between them. Both windows met the requirements, the first was a business card, and the second was a mini portfolio with a short about section. 

There was navigation between the windows, however the tabs were sort of hard to find. They were at the bottom in small text on a white background, and didn't have any icons associated with them. Enlarging the text for these tabs and adding some images would improve navigation a lot. 

The views scaled however the text didn't, I ran it on an ipad 2 emulator and an iphone 6 emulator, it wasn't hard to read on either emulator however the text size didn't scale with the larger device. This was something I struggled with in my own homework so I don't have a solution for properly scaling fonts to screen size.
